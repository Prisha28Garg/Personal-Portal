        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My name is Prisha Garg. I was born to Swati Garg and Vijay Garg on December 28, 2010, born at Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, Punjabi Bagh in Delhi, India. My time of arrival was 8:56 A.M., my weight was, 3.1kg and my height was, 52cm. I have a younger brother named Pratim Garg. I was the 1st child in my house. My name, Prisha, is a Hindu name and means “God’s Gift” and my lucky number is 8. My parents had a few names planned, like in case of a boy, they would have named me Vihaan. But I was a girl, so, the options were Prisha, Pankhuri and Pranaya. My Chachi had suggested my name, and everyone liked it. So, I am Prisha.<br><br>My mom wrote few lines herself for me, which she wrote in the invitations: “A sweet little angel came knocking on the door, and filled our lives with happiness, joy and much much more. Cute, adorable, sweet little doll our ‘GOD’S GIFT – PRISHA’ is a wonder for all!” I love these lines which my mom wrote for me! </p>

        <div class="line"></div> <img src="Likes%20&%20Dislikes.jfif" class="caption" />
        <p>I do more of what makes me happy! My hobbies are coding and reading. Some of my favourite novels are: Tom Gates, Malory Towers, Bad Mermaids and Wimpy Kid. I love many types of food, like: Maggi, Lasagne, Risotto, Gollgappe, Chhole Bhatura, etc. So, I have a huge food junkie. I loved my trip to Greece, especially the villa which we got there, Arota. Some of the web series I like watching are: Just Add Magic, Worst Witch, Good Witch, and Mako Mermaids. I don’t like getting bored, of course nobody does. Novels without pictures don’t interest me. I am not too much a sportsperson. I don’t like winters, but I can’t even hate it because my birthday comes in winters. </p>

        <p>Someone once told me, ‘All of our HOPES and DREAMS are within reach, only if we BELIEVE.’ I love learning new things and teaching. So, when I grow up, either I want to be a coding teacher, or a language/UOI teacher. I love to help people. I hope when I grow up, I am able to help people in some way or the other. But my dream is to become a teacher. When I told my coding teacher this she said, she’s very happy that some of us out there still want to be teachers and being a teacher means learning new things and evolving yourself every day, while teaching. I got my inspiration to become a teacher from the opportunities that we get at school to teach something to the class as a teacher. </p>

        <div class="line"></div> <img src="my%20words%20of%20wisdom.jpg" class="caption" />
        <p>Being unique is better than being perfect. My
            parents have always inspired me to work hard,
            never give up and have a balanced life. Even if you
            fail, never give up because F.A.I.L means "The
            first attempt in learning."
            When I talk about myself, I love to explore new
            things. I keep trying new things and I always feel,
            "We should keep practicing until we get good at
            it!".
            When we all try different things, we usually don't
            get the hang of it on the 1st go, but if we give up
            and don't try it over again, we will never learn
            anything new. and that's what happened to me.
            After a class on HTML, I told my mom that text
            coding is hard and I couldn't understand. I got a
            project related to it and my teacher said I should
            try my best and give it a shot and if I needed
            guidance, she's always available. Then, my mom said,
            "Keep trying and if you still don't get it then, ask
            for guidance." and that's what I did. I practiced and
            practiced and now I can do it comfortably. I
            recently overcame this challenge. Though, my
            teachers and my parents are my backbone and help
            me climb my ladder.
            The key is always to 'Never give up, keep trying
            and if you feel low, then ask for guidance.' and that's
            what I have learned in the past couple of years. </p>
